# Neurofeedback Induced Desynchronization of Sensorimotor Rhythm

This repository contains code and data related to "Neurofeedback-induced desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm elicits pre-movement downregulation of intracortical inhibition that shortens simple reaction time in humans: a double-blind sham-controlled randomized study".

## Introduction

Neurofeedback is a technique that allows individuals to self-regulate their brain activity by providing real-time feedback. In this study, we investigate the effects of neurofeedback on the sensorimotor rhythm, which is associated with motor control and movement.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2. Run each code in MATLAB.
